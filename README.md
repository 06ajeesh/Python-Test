## Python-Test

Given a Word document containing multiple choice questions (MCQs). Each question is formatted
with the question itself followed by four options (A, B, C, D) and the correct answer at the end. Develop a
Python program to parse this document and convert the set of questions into a JSON file.

GUIDELINES:
- Use Python libraries such as python-docx to read the Word document.
- Ensure your code is well-structured and commented, especially in parts where the parsing logic
might be complex.
- Consider how your program could be scaled or modified to handle variations in the question format
or document structure
